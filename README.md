Christmas-themed technical challenge app

Originally run as a team-building exercise for my team at Oxford Brookes University,
where team members had to find clues hidden around the University, solve the puzzles they contained to get the codes,
and then use the codes with the app to find the secret Christmas password.
The fastest team completed the challenge in around 2.5 hours.

If you're going to try the challenge at home, DON'T READ THE SOURCE CODE.
